                <p>The Martin Family: Ben üíñ Doris, Andy (18), Andrew (15), Audrey (11), Anna (9), Amanda (1-1/2 mo.)</p>
                
                <p>Anna sat comfortably looking at a cat picture book. She flipped the page and immediately, she knew she wanted a kitten. In front of her yes, there was a little brown kitten with white socks. "Mother, can I have this kitten?" Anna asked, holding up the picture book.</p>
                
                <p>Well, you have to learn how to lcean up your messes, then, Father and I will think about it." Mother asnwered, washing another dish. Anna flipped another page. She stared at the pictures of the beautiful kittens. She closed the book and got up from the couch and went to Audrey's room.</p>
                
                <p>Opening the door, Anna found Audrey reading Stronger than Fire. "Mother might get me a cat!" Anna exclaimed. "Huh?" Audrey said, looking up from  her book. "I said, Mother might get me a cat!"</p>
                
                <p>"This book is so interesting! It's about Casiodoro and how he translated the Bible into Spanish," Audrey said, bending her head again to the book. Anna skipped back to the kitchen and found Mother making dinner.</p>
                
                <p>That night, Anna dreamed that she got a kitten that was brown with white socks. Then, it was suddenly time to wake up."</p>
                
                <p>Today was Sunday and she would wear a good dress. Anna ran down the stairs and helped Mother set the table. After church, Anna's family visited Grandma Martin. When they came home, Anna flopped on the couch and again loocked at the cat picture book.</p>
                
                <p>Can you hold Amanda?" Mother asked, coming into the living room. "Sure!" Anna agreed, reaching out her hands.</p>
                
                <p>Suddenly, Father came holding a brown kitten with white socks! "Father, where did you get that kitten !?" Anna asked, looking at the little kitten. "Why, I got it from Auntie Audrey, she said she thought that you might want it," Father said, smiling at her. "Thank you!"</p>
                
                <p>That afternoon Anna played with her kitten. Anna named her kitten Sally.</p>
                
                <p>One winter day, Anna asked Mother, "May we go sledding?" "Sure!" was the answer. Anna brought out Sally, and held her in the sled! "Now don't jump off!" Anna said, getting into the sled with her kitten. "Ready?" Andrew asked, taking hold of the sled. "Yes!" Anna went whizzing down the hill.</p>
                
                <p>At the end, Anna asked "Did you like it?" "Meow!" Sally answered, as if to say, "I liked it!"</p>
                
                <p>That summer, Sally disappeared! "Mother, Sally is gone," Anna said sadly at the breakfast table. "Don't worry," Andy comforted. "It'll probably come back."</p>
                
                <p>One week later, Sally came back with four little kittens behind her! "Sally had kittens and, she came back!" Anna went running out the door, holding a bowl of cat food. "Sally, you made me kittens!" Anna said, staring in disbelief.</p>
                
                <p>That night, she dreamed that she got to keep all the little kittens! Then when she woke up, the family ate scrambled eggs with cheese and sourdough bread. Then after cleaning, Anna played with the little kittens.</p>
